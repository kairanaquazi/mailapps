A few different mail apps to try out

Your email MUST be able to have external apps use it: <a href='https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1'> set this to true</a>
You will have to add your own email and password because I am NOT giving you mine
On all the apps there is an input for your email and password

Requirements: flask, flask_mail
